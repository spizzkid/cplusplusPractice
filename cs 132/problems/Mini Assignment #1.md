## Using what you have learned about the cString style data types, download and complete the code for the program below.

InClassAssignment1.cpp

 

Notes:

- You may not modify or change the main() or the method prototypes.
- You are only to implement the 4 necessary methods.
- You will want to look for the '\0' character to find the ends of the strings. 
- You may want to think about using while loops instead of for loops for some of the methods.
- Your methods may use each other if you find that helpful. 
  - In fact,  hint!  you might find it easier to write the last one first....
- DO NOT USE ANY STRING TOOLS,  you must use the CSTRING ideas that we talked about in class for full credit.
- Manipulate the char's and the array!
