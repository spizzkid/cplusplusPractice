This program is designed to simply get you back into the C++ mind frame and refresh your skills, so do not overdo it or assume that there is anything tricky going on.

 Make sure to comment/header all files.

Write a C++ program that does the following:

Outputs your formal name.
Outputs your preferred name to be called.  (This may be the same as above)
Outputs what would you like to learn in this class?
Then print a line of 50 or more stars("*") as a break between sections.
Asks the user the following question and wait for a number answer.
"What size word do you want?"
Make sure that they input a number between 1 and 30.
Use an input validation loop.
Open up the file : WordList.txtPreview the document 
This file contains a large number (> 150000) of single English words.
Count how many words there are of that length and print it out.
In order to find the size of a string
#include <string>
Then use strname.length() to get the length of a string.
For example x = myString.length();
Close the file.
Create an array the size of your count, or create a vector.
For an array, you will need to use a pointe to get it of the correct size.
Reopen the WordList.txt file.
Read all the words of that are the same size as the indicated size into the array/vector.
Write all the words from that array onto the screen AND into a file backward.  
The file name should be WordFile2.txt 
So for example,
if the user selected words of size 3, then I  should see "ZOO" before I see "AND".
Close both files.
Open the original file one more time.
Find the largest word in the list and print it out.
